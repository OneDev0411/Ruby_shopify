# If you don't have an API key yet, register your application at:
# 
# <YourShopURL>/admin/api (e.g. "http://shopname.myshopify.com/admin/api")


# Be sure to conceal these credentials if you make your application code public.
# If you're using Git, put the following line in a file called .gitignore in your
# repository root:
# 
#   config/shopify.yml
# 
# If you're using SVN, you can run this command from the application root:
# 
#   svn propedit svn:ignore ./config/shopify.yml

development:
  api_key: <%= api_key %>
  secret: <%= secret %>

test:
  api_key: <%= api_key %>
  secret: <%= secret %>


# For added security in your production deployment, you can register for a second
# set of credentials and store them in environment variables on your server as
# shown below. If you are deploying to Heroku, you use config vars for this purpose:
# 
#  http://docs.heroku.com/config-vars
  
production:
  api_key: <%%= ENV['SHOPIFY_API_KEY'] %>
  secret: <%%= ENV['SHOPIFY_API_SECRET'] %>
