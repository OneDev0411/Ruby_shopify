Releasing ShopifyApp

1. Check the Semantic Versioning page for info on how to version the new release: http://semver.org
1. Create a pull request with the following changes:
    - Update the version of ShopifyApp in lib/shopify_app/version.rb
    - Update the version of shopify_app in package.json
    - Add a CHANGELOG entry for the new release with the date
    - Change the title of the PR to something like: "Packaging for release X.Y.Z"
1. Merge your pull request
1. Checkout and pull from master so you have the latest version of the shopify_app
1. Tag the HEAD with the version
```bash
$ git tag -f vX.Y.Z && git push --tags --force
```
1. Use Shipit to build and push the gem

If you see an error like 'You need to create the vX.Y.X tag first', clear GIT
cache in Shipit settings
